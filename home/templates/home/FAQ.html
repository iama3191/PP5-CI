                <p class="mt-3 mx-3">A) You can shop any of our cakes from our website <a href="https://wondercakes.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">Wonder Cakes.</a></p>

                <p class="mt-3 mx-3"><strong>Q) The cake I want is not on your website, what can I do?</strong></p>
                <p class="mt-3 mx-3">A) No problem! If you have a specific color scheme and decoration for your dream cake, you can email it to us at <a href="mailto: wonder.cakes.22@gmail.com?subject=Custom Cake">wonder.cakes.22@gmail.com</a>.</p>

                <p class="mt-3 mx-3"><strong>Q) How long do I need to order in advance?</strong></p>
                <p class="mt-3 mx-3">A) Our cakes are hand-crafted. Many can be made within a week, however, the most intrincate designs can take up to 14 days. Our <strong>quick cakes</strong> can be delivered within a week and our <strong>cupcakes</strong> within 3 days.</p>

                <p class="mt-3 mx-3"><strong>Q) How long do your cakes last?</strong></p>
                <p class="mt-3 mx-3">A) The chocolate, vanilla sponge, red velvet, pumpkin, lemon and carrot cakes should last 5 days if they are stored at room temperature in a cool place. Once cut the cake should be kept airtight to retain the freshness. Do not put any of our cakes in the fridge, as this will affect the quality. It is possible to freeze leftover cake, however, please be aware that the icing will be impaired.</p>

                <p class="mt-3 mx-3"><strong>Q) What about allergy information?</strong></p>
                <p class="mt-3 mx-3">A) All our cakes are baked and decorated in an environment where nuts are present. Unless specified otherwise cakes may contain <strong class="text-uppercase">nuts, milk, eggs, wheat,soya, gluten, lupin, sesame seeds & sulphur dioxide.</strong></p>
